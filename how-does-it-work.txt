SYSCHECK DESCRIPTION (STEPS)

IP ADDRESS =====================================================================
- We start by creating a cache file stored in /tmp/ and creating variables 'ipdev',
which we will later use to increment to show number of internet devices and 'first_run'
variable.

- For loop is used to iterate over findings of grep 'command' which searches for
internet devices (text returned by 'ip addr' command). '-P' flag stands for using
a Perl RegEx and '-o' for returning only a matched word.

- If condition checks whether current grep finding describes an IP address or some
other information. If it describes IP we append current address to a cache file.


RAM ============================================================================
- Using a Perl RegEx we search for a matches of current RAM configuration. '-h' flag
stands for 'human' (showing results in suitable form eg. gigabytes).

- Result is appended to a cache file.


CPU INFORMATION ================================================================
- The CPU information is stored in /proc/cpuinfo file, thus we append it to a cache
file.


MAIL ===========================================================================
- Firstly we check if logs.log file exists, if not we know we need to create it,
put cache information to it and send a mail with a current configuration (first_run=0).

- Second if statement checks whether logs.log and syscheck.cache file are different,
if so the script copies text from cache file to a log file and sends a mail.
'-s' flag stands for 'subject' of a mail to <EMAIL>. If the files are the same,
a script gives information about no parameter change.

-!!! To correctly send a mail, script needs to have /etc/sstmp/ssmtp.conf file
configured (of course it doesn't need to be gmail, but if it is some different domain
you need to check your mail security settings). Moreover check if TLS_CA_FILE is
correctly specified. If a certificate is not correct it will return your mail.
